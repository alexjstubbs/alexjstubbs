<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hello 👋, my name is Alex and I am a "<strong>full stack web software engineer with a front end focus</strong>," a proponent of the <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/" target="_blank">small web</a>, and a retro hardware enthusiast.</p>

<p>I started designing and developing websites way back in 1997 on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Net_Link" target="_blank">Sega Saturn Netlink</a>. Without a keyboard in hand, I hand-wrote my table based HTML markup in old notebooks to transcribe into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface" target="_blank">CGI</a> web editors utilizing an on-screen keyboard and controller, and of course, all while collaborating over IRC.</p>

<p>Luckily, times have changed and I now own both multiple PC's and keyboards. I have since worked on countless projects from interesting startups in various spaces, to enterprise level applications, goverment funded incentivized data applications, as well as multiple personal and collaborative projects. I also founded <a href="https://www.elemeno.dev/" target="_blank">Elemeno</a>, a collective of talent functioning as a digital agency. You have most likely even seen some of my design work for large brand-names in the market while shopping around with your spouse.</p>
