<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hello 👋, my name is Alex and I am a "full stack web software engineer with a front end focus," a proponent of the [small web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/), and a retro hardware enthusiast.</p>

<p>I started designing and developing websites way back in 1997 on a [Sega Saturn Netlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Net_Link). Without a keyboard in hand, I hand-wrote my table based HTML markup in old notebooks to transcribe into [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) web editors utilizing an on-screen keyboard and controller, and of course, all while collaborating over IRC.</p>

<p>Luckily, times have changed and I now own both multiple PC's and keyboards. I have since worked on countless projects from interesting startups in various spaces, to enterprise level applications, as well as multiple personal and collaborative projects. I also founded [Elemeno](https://www.elemeno.dev/), a collective of talent functioning as a digital agency. You have most likely even seen some of my design work for large brand-names in the market.</p>
