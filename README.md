<summary>A little history</summary>

Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Alex and I am a "full stack web software engineer with a front-end focus," a proponent of the small web, and a retro hardware enthusiast.

I started designing and developing websites way back in 1997 on a Sega Saturn Netlink. Without a keyboard in hand, I hand-wrote my table based HTML markup in old notebooks to transcribe into CGI web editors utilizing an on-screen keyboard and controller, and of course, all while collaborating over IRC.

Luckily, times have changed and I now own both multiple PC's and keyboards. I have since worked on countless projects from interesting startups in various spaces, to enterprise level applications, as well as multiple personal and collaborative projects. I also founded Elemeno, a collective of talent functioning as a digital agency. You have most likely even seen some of my design work for large brand-names in the market.
